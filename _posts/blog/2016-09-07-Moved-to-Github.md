I moved to github pages to use Jekyll. This costs me no effort to make a great site.
I'm in the process of setting this up, so currently still pretty empty and I added
some random pictures that I took.

# Credit where credit is due
I first cloned the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) repo from [barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark/), it started me thinking about using jekyll stuff.
But after a quick DuckDuckGo I found the [so-simple-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by [mmistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/), which is a little bit more to my liking.
