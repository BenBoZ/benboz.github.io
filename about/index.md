Hi, look at the picture, that's me! My name is Ben Spoor and I love to program.

I was working as a lighting technician, aka a 'Lampie', which _sparked_ my interest in electronics.
So I went to college to become a Electrical Engineer.
I spent my days creating electronics and programming all kinds of devices (PLC's, mcus, FPGA's).
This started my passion in programming, especially image processing and FPGA's.
During my study I did a part-time internship at [Axon](https://www.axon.tv/EN/home) and I could go wild on FPGA's, C++ and SciLab.

Currently I'm employed by [Altran](https://www.altran.nl) (formerly TASS), and for the last few years I've worked for [ASML](https://www.asml.com/).
Here I filled a number of roles, mainly using Python & C.

Recently I started immersing myself into debugging practices, which reminds me of my lighting technician days in which _'The show must go on'_ was the only rule.
I hope to have some in-depth info on this blog about debugging, next to more general reports of my endeavors in the world of programming.

You can contact me through any of the channels below!
