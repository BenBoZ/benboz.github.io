Hi, look at the picture, thats me! My name is Ben Spoor and I love to program. 

<img src="bio-photo.png" alt="Thats me!" style="width: 200px;"/>

I was working as a lighting technician, aka a 'Lampie'. 
Got interested in electronics and started studying to become a Electrical Engineer.
The one thing I've learned during my study, is that the digital and analog worlds are two quite different things.
That's why I fell for programming during that time, especcially image processing and FPGA's.
During my study I did a parttime internship at Axon and I could go wild on FPGA's, C++ and SciLab.
Currently I'm employed by Altran (formerly TASS), and for the last few years I've worked for ASML.
Where I filled a number of roles, mainly using Python & C.

Recently I started immersing myself into debugging practices, which reminds me of my lighting technician days in which 'The show must go on' mantra was always present.  I hope to have some in-depth info on this blog about debugging, next to more general reports of my endeavours in the world of programming.

* Python
* (Ba)sh
* VHDL
* SciLab
* Vim
* Regex
